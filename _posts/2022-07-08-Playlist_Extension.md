I've loved exploring new music to find artists or songs that are just so damn good -- especially when the source is unexpected. 
I consider myself specific song chaser more than sticking with an artist. Even with artists that I like -- it's only most of their songs that appeals to me -- while other songs are just bad. 
I've liked vibes and specific sounds more. 


To make the song finding process easier, I ran a few machine learning models on a playlist of 50 of my favourite songs and manualy rated them to train the dataset. 
Result is a 1.5k song that's scawered all over Spotify to find songs that are in close proximity to my eclectic taste. 
Surprisingly it seems to be working -- I've liked almost every song I've heard so far.
Will update soon, but the code is linked [here](https://github.com/amenti4k/add-musik)

And below is the playlist.
