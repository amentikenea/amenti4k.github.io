### P0D

Starting this off, I want to say, I'm one of the peple that wants to see crypto be the next revolution in technology and be the bridge in the nex generation of computing -- Web3. Damn I've even written my 2 year graduation thesis paper on formalizing the stability of algorithmic-stablecoins (in which I predicted Seigniorage Share stablecoin protocols of the likes of Terra and Basis Coin would not work). Being honest, like most of my peers I'm excited about crypto due to selfish reasons of being in the frontier of a generation defining product. Being at the forefront also means you'd create the killer-app, or be part of the intial teams ($$$) of people that made the killer apps (i.e, refer to all the tech billionares -- part of web2 frontlines). This bias added with the financializaiton of crypto (!likk here) that gives immediate financial upsdie to early adoptors leads to every crypto adoptor becoming a crypto evangalist faster -- reducing the layer of experimentation   almost all of us from being intellectually honest  in a

The nuance of the debates take a less dramatic ("are there any use cases"),but more nuanced debate of whether there will be use cases that, collectively, are worth the hype. In other words, are **killer apps** even a possiblity? 

Zach has been fighting rounds with a bunch of names including Mike Dudas, Packy McCormick, and Aztec's John Wu (personal favorite), and the Web3 funding behemoth a16z's Shaun Maguire!
