**[Cartoon Avatars](https://open.spotify.com/episode/17ypXXaDRYHDRCq5eyGRt5?si=38c0c81ff5034808) - Recently the rebranded (prev. 3 Cartoon Avatars) has been gaining momentum from their niche VC audience talking about startups and markets (memed themselves as "the world doesn't need another podcast of VC bros talking to each other) to the bigger Web3 community by having regular debates on the viability of Web3.**

Taking the anti-Web3 side (well not neccesarily anti, but "reduce the hype", but I'll keep using anti for hype purposes) is the "big boss of Web 3 hate"

On the opposing side, OG Cartoon Avatar [@Logan Bartlett](https://twitter.com/loganbartlett) brings in crypto's degens to fight with their chains. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Correct. The issue is not are there use cases in general. The issue is are there enough use cases (that arenâ€™t driven by speculation) that are superior to the regular web in such a way that consumers adopt at scale.</p>&mdash; Aaron Levie (@levie) <a href="https://twitter.com/levie/status/1540058667835215873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></blockquote>

The nuance of the debates take a less dramatic ("are there any use cases"),but more nuanced debate of whether there will be use cases that, collectively, are worth the hype. In other words, are **killer apps** even a possiblity? 

Zach has been fighting rounds with a bunch of names including Mike Dudas, Packy McCormick, and Aztec's John Wu (personal favorite), and the Web3 funding behemoth a16z's Shaun Maguire!
